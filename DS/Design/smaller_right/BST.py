"""
You are given an input array A of n distinct numbers, and you want to compute an output array B, in
which B[i] is the number of such elements in A: (a) the element appears after A[i] in A, and (b) the
element is strictly smaller than A[i].
For example, if the input is A = [3; 5; 1; 4; 7; 6; 2], then the output should be B = [2; 3; 0; 1; 2; 1; 0]. Because
in A, after 3 (i.e., A[1]) there are 2 elements that are smaller than 3 (i.e., 1 and 2); and after 5 (i.e., A[2])
there are 3 elements that are smaller than 5 (i.e., 1, 4 and 2), etc.
Now you need to design an algorithm that computes B using A. The runtime of your algorithm must be
O(n log n) in worst case, where n is the size of A.
"""

# Method 1: Use an AVL-Tree

# Method 2: Use a BST-tree
"""
In this approach, we traverse the input array from the ending to the begging and add the elements into the BST.
While inserting the elements to the BST, we can compute the number of elements which are lesser elements simply 
by computing the sum of frequency of the element and the number of elements to the left side of current node,
if we are moving to right side of the current node.
Once we place an element in itâ€™s correct position, we can return this sum value.
